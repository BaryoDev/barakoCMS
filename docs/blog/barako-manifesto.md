# Stronger than your Average Joe: The BarakoCMS Manifesto ☕

*December 1, 2025 • By Arnel Robles (Founder, BaryoDev)*

I’ve been writing code for 15 years, which in "JavaScript years" is approximately three centuries. I’ve seen frameworks come and go like bad fashion trends. I’ve survived the rise and fall of dozens of CMS platforms, the kind that promise you the world but deliver a headache so big it needs its own zip code. 

I’ve dealt with the bloat of WordPress (my plugin folder once had more layers than a lasagna), the complexity of Drupal, and those modern headless systems that are so abstract you need a philosophy degree and a GraphQL exorcist just to fetch a "Hello World" title.

One night, sitting in my kitchen with a steaming cup of **Kapeng Barako**, I looked at my screen and then at my coffee. I realized something: we’ve lost our way. We’re building digital machines that are so heavy they’d sink a battleship, all to serve a simple blog post or a landing page.

That was the night BarakoCMS was born.

## Why "Barako"?

In the Philippines, "Barako" isn't just coffee; it’s an attitude. It’s the liberica bean—strong, pungent, and carries a body that hits you like a freight train with a grudge. It’s the drink for people who need to get things done—people from the **baryo** (that’s "barrio" for the Spanish-inclined, but we spell it with a 'y' because we like our Tagalog gritty and localized). 

In the baryo, we don't have time for half-caf, double-pump, oat-milk lattes with a dash of unicorn sparkles. We need something that works.

I wanted this CMS to be exactly that. **Strong. Bold. Minimalist. Grounded.**

## The "Baryo Dev" Spirit

I identify as a **"developer from the baryo."** It’s a mindset of resourcefulness. When you don't have the fastest fiber connection or the latest M3 Max that costs more than a small car, you learn to appreciate efficiency. 

You learn that every extra kilobyte of JavaScript is a tiny thief stealing your user's data plan. You learn that simplicity isn't just a design choice; it's a survival tactic. BarakoCMS is a rebellion against "Enterprise Bloat"—because no one should have to download the entire internet just to read an article.

## Our Three Pillars

1.  **Lightweight Strength**: We use .NET and PostgreSQL, but we use them lean. No unnecessary abstractions. No magic that you can't debug at 2 AM when your eyes are crossing and you're questioning your career choices.
2.  **Radical Transparency**: With Event Sourcing (built on Marten), we don't just store what happened; we store the *why* and the *when*. It's a system with a memory better than your ex.
3.  **Developer Independence**: You shouldn't need a consulting firm and a three-week seminar to deploy a CMS. It should be "One-Click" ready, whether you're on a $5 VPS or a global cloud cluster.

## This is Just the Beginning

This isn't just a project for me. It’s a journey. Over the next month, I’ll be sharing the stories of the technical hurdles and those "aha" moments that usually happen right after I’ve given up and decided to become a goat farmer.

We're going back to basics. We're making the web strong again. Grab a cup of coffee—make it a Barako—it’s going to be a long, exciting brew.

### 🌿 Life Lesson from the Baryo
In the baryo, we have a saying: *“Pag may tiyaga, may nilaga.”* (If there is perseverance, there is stew.) Building something meaningful doesn't require the flashiest tools; it requires the grit to stay with the pot until the soup is rich and the meat is tender. Don't chase the trend; chase the soul of the work.
