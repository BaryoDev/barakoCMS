# Stronger than your Average Joe: The BarakoCMS Manifesto ☕

*December 1, 2025 • By Arnel Robles (Founder, BaryoDev)*

I’ve been writing code for 15 years. I’ve seen the rise and fall of dozens of CMS platforms. I’ve dealt with the bloat of WordPress, the complexity of Drupal, and the "modern" headless systems that require a PhD in GraphQL just to fetch a title.

One night, sitting in my kitchen with a steaming cup of **Kapeng Barako**, I realized something: we’ve lost our way. We’re building machines that are too heavy for the people they’re supposed to serve.

That was the night BarakoCMS was born.

## Why "Barako"?

In the Philippines, "Barako" refers to the liberica coffee bean. It’s known for its strong, pungent aroma and a body that hits you like a freight train. It’s a coffee for people who need to get things done—people from the *barrio* who don't have time for fancy lattes and flavored syrups.

I wanted this CMS to be exactly that. **Strong. Bold. Minimalist. Grounded.**

## The "Barrio Dev" Spirit

I identify as a "developer from the barrio." It’s a mindset of resourcefulness. When you don't have the fastest fiber connection or the latest M3 Max, you learn to appreciate efficiency. You learn that every extra kilobyte of JavaScript has a cost. You learn that simplicity isn't just a design choice; it's a necessity.

BarakoCMS is a rebellion against "Enterprise Bloat."

## Our Three Pillars

1.  **Lightweight Strength**: We use .NET and PostgreSQL, but we use them lean. No unnecessary abstractions. No magic that you can't debug at 2 AM.
2.  **Radical Transparency**: With Event Sourcing (built on Marten), we don't just store what happened; we store the *why* and the *when*. It's a system with a memory.
3.  **Developer Independence**: You shouldn't need a consulting firm to deploy a CMS. It should be "One-Click" ready, whether you're on a $5 VPS or a global cloud.

## This is Just the Beginning

This isn't just a project for me. It’s a journey. Over the next month, I’ll be sharing the stories of the technical hurdles and the architectural "aha" moments that turned a midnight thought into a working platform.

We're going back to basics. We're making the web strong again. Grab a cup of coffee—it’s going to be a long, exciting brew.
